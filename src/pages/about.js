          I'm currently living in the southern part of Texas right along the
          border. I hop back and forth between working on client projects and
          focusing on a few exciting ventures.

          When I find free time I like jump rope and do some other active
          things. It is not always easy, but I try to stick to a keto diet üç≥

          Even when I am not working, I still catch myself thinking (or
          daydreaming) about how to improve current projects. I keep an open
          mind so I can find ways to take my development and management skills
          to the next level.
