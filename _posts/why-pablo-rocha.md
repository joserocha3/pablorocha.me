Hello Toptal team,

I’m a React.js developer based out of South Texas, and I create moduar, efficient, and clean code. I try to leave every bit I code I touch more readable and performant than I found it. I’ve worked with fortune 500 companies such as [Tyson Foods](https://tysonfoods.com) and international business such as [White Rabbit Japan](https://www.whiterabbitjapan.com). I have also worked with many local businesses such as [Los Pinos Hardware](https://lospinoshardware.com) and [Pawsome Dogs Training & Behavior](https://www.pawsomedogs.net/).

Beyond a simple a React.js developer, I am also a bit of a tech entrepreneur. I have founded of a couple of startups that are on their way to making their mark in their respective areas. Within those startups I do everything from frontend to backend coding, organizing client interations, as well as handle day-to-day affairs that affect our business.

As of late I have been taking on more freelance work, and I enjoy learning about a client's business and helping them acheive their desired outcome. That along with my strong React.js and organization skills makes me a great fit for Totpal's best [freelance React.js developers](https://www.toptal.com/react).

Let’s chat about how I could put my various tech skills to work for Toptal's clients. Thank you for your consideration.

Pablo Rocha
